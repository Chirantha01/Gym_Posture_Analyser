Features
Pose Analysis and Feedback: Real-time analysis of user posture with corrective suggestions.
Workout Tracking: Monitor and record exercise performance and progress.
Dashboard Visualization: View workout statistics and improvements over time.
User-friendly Interface: Easy-to-navigate UI with engaging feedback visuals.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React Native, JavaScript
Machine Learning: MoveNet Lightning (SinglePose 256x256)
Backend: REST API
Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

Prerequisites
Node.js (version 20)
React Native CLI
MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas (for backend storage)

Usage
Open the app on your mobile device.
Start a workout session and select an exercise.
GYMPRO will analyze your posture and provide instant feedback and corrections.
Model Details
The posture analysis model uses MoveNet Lightning (SinglePose 256x256), a fast and efficient model for real-time body landmark detection.

Supported Exercises:

Bicep Curls (Arms)
Squats (Legs)
Push-Ups (Chest)
Lat Pull-Downs (Back)
Planks (Abs)
Model Architecture:

Simple neural network using Adam optimizer and Cross-Entropy Loss.
Confusion matrices to evaluate model performance on each exercise.
Data Collection and Processing
The dataset includes both dynamic and static posture data:

Dynamic Exercises: Custom-collected data for exercises.
Static Exercises: Web-scraped images for postures (e.g., planks).
Data is processed into a 256x256 padded format with 17 landmark points in the (x, y, probability) format.
